# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ RISC-V SoC Lab â€“ C2S Program

Welcome to the RISC-V SoC Lab repository for C2S participants. This project is part of the **Chip to Startup (C2S)** initiative by the Government of India, aimed at enabling students and researchers to design and build silicon chips using open-source RISC-V architecture.

## ðŸ“Œ About

This repository is maintained by shortlisted participants from institutes with access to **Synopsys tools** and **SCL180 PDK** under the C2S program.

## ðŸ”° Current Phase

- **Phase 1:** Toolchain installation, repository setup, and basic functional validation (e.g., compiling and simulating `Hello, RISC-V`).

## ðŸ›  Tools

- Synopsys EDA Suite  
- SCL180nm PDK  
- RISC-V GCC Toolchain
