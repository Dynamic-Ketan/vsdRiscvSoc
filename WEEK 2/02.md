# üõ†Ô∏è Task 2: Top-Level Orientation

## 1. Four Major Sub-modules Instantiated Inside Caravel

1. **`padframe`** ‚Äì Interfaces the chip with the external world. It manages I/O pads, applies ESD protection, and routes power/ground signals across different voltage domains.

2. **`caravel_core`** ‚Äì The main logic wrapper that instantiates both the management SoC and the user project area. It connects internal functional blocks to the padframe.

3. **Management SoC** ‚Äì Located within `caravel_core`, this submodule houses the RISC-V core, SPI, UART, GPIO controller, flash interface, and Wishbone master. It is responsible for overall chip control and secure operations.

4. **`user_project_wrapper`** ‚Äì Also within `caravel_core`, this is the designated region for user-defined designs. It interfaces with the management SoC through Wishbone and shares I/Os with external pins via the padframe.

## 2. Signals that Cross the ‚ÄúManagement Protect‚Äù Boundary

These signals travel between the trusted management domain and the untrusted user domain:

- **GPIOs**:  
  `mprj_io_in`, `mprj_io_out`, `mprj_io_oeb` ‚Äì User I/O pads shared between management and user logic

- **Flash signals**:  
  `flash_io0`, `flash_io1`, `flash_csb`, `flash_clk` ‚Äì Shared flash communication lines

- **System signals**:  
  `clock_core` ‚Äì Primary clock distributed to both domains  
  `rstb_h` ‚Äì Synchronized reset signal

- **Wishbone bus**:  
  Internal bus used for communication between the management SoC and the user project wrapper

- **Logic analyzer interface**:  
  Debug/monitoring interface for observing or injecting signals across the user boundary

## 3. Reset and Clock Synchronization Points

- **Clock**:  
  The `clock` input enters through the `padframe`, becomes `clock_core`, and is distributed via the `clocking_and_dll` block inside `caravel_core`.

- **Reset**:  
  The `resetb` input is inverted and passed through the `padframe` as `rstb_h`. Synchronization occurs within the management SoC using `por_l` and related logic.
